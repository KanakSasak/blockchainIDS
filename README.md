Blockchain networks face evolving security threats. Addressing this, a proposed protocol anticipates attacks before transaction mining. By monitoring real-time transaction patterns, it detects anomalies indicative of potential attacks. Suspicious transactions undergo added verification layers or are quarantined for in-depth investigation. A timely alert system notifies participants of threats, while mechanisms are in place for transaction reversal or network healing, ensuring security without compromising decentralization.
